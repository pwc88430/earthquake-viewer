## Part 3: Retrospect

> The most important thing that I have learned from this project is the importance to plan out
> most aspects before begining.  For example, I had not fully thought out how I was going to implement
> the second API into my project before starting.  Once I finished implementing the first one, locating an
> api that I could use to get the information that I wanted was very time consuming.  I should have identified
> and completely tested both API's before trying to implement either of them.
